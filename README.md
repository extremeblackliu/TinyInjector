# TinyInjector

A tiny injector using LoadLibrary written in ASM.

This injector uses plain LoadLibrary without any protection or bypasses. This will probably get you VAC banend or the injection will fail due to trusted launch.
You can use your favorite VAC bypass in conjunction with this injector.

## Default configuration

- Process name: `csgo.exe`
- DLL path: `1.dll` (relative to current working directory)

Process name and dll can be changed in lines 18 and 20.
